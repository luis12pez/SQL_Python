Each case study will be presented on its own separated branch, encompassing raw data, analysis, and associated files or links to the visualization. Additionally, every branch will contain a README.cd file providing an explanation of the respective case.

## DATA ANALYSIS WORKFLOW

1. Databases available either in  public serves (such as ElephantSQL) or the file(s)/link will be available to download locally.
2. Data cleaning, primary visualization, and transformation is performed with the help of Python and MS Excel, depending on the specific cases.
